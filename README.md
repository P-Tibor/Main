- ðŸ‘€ I'm currently working in the chemical industry after finishing Chemistry MSc. Looking to broaden my views since Python is a new passion of mine, possibly changing career path in the future.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python, planning on picking up Flask, Django, NumPy, pytest, TensorFlow etc. on the way!
